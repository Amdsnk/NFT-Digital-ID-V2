Below is the summary of the Web3 & NFT system that will be developed for FirstStepAI, a global AI startup with a community-driven approach.

üìå 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
Project Name: FirstStepAI Web3 Identity System

Goal: To build a decentralized digital identity system for users, using NFTs combined with a community contribution model.

üõ†Ô∏è 2. FEATURE SCOPE
NFT Soul ID (Non-Transferrable, Unique Per User)

1 user = 1 unique NFT (not a tradable collection)

NFTs are non-transferable by default

Can be inherited with internal approval process

Trust-to-Earn System

User earns points through active contribution (not staking)

Points used to access voting, level upgrades, and internal rewards

Voting DAO (Limited Community)

Voting system based on trust scores

Access limited to active and trusted users

User & Admin Dashboards

User: view NFT, trust score, badges

Admin: approval management, verification, score reset, reputation control

Web3 Wallet Login

Integration with MetaMask, WalletConnect, and Phantom

Approval-Based NFT Transfer

NFTs cannot be freely traded

Transfer requires system validation and approval

Public Contribution Log ("Flame Log")

Public log of user activity and contributions

Functions as a transparent reputation system

Smart Contract + Backend Integration

Fully connected to main website

Open-source and auditable

üß± 3. PREFERRED TECHNOLOGIES
Blockchain: Solana or Polygon (we are open to discussion)

Front End: Any modern framework ‚Äî must be clean, responsive, and accessible

Wallet Support: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Phantom

üöÄ Developer Wanted
We are building a global Web3-based community platform, and we‚Äôre looking for a Web3 Developer to support the development of:

NFT User Access
(1 unique NFT per user ‚Äî not mass collectible)

Contribution-Based Reward System
(users earn points from active participation, not staking)

Simplified DAO Voting System
(value-based access, not overly complex governance)

NFT Transfer Approval Flow
(transfers between users require system-level approval)

üîß Additional Requirements
Clean and functional User & Admin Dashboards

Web3 Wallet Login (MetaMask / WalletConnect / Phantom)

Preferably familiar with Polygon or Solana ecosystems

Design must be modern, responsive, and user-friendly (Replit UI must reflect quality)

‚úÖ Replit Requirements (Make this clear to your Replit project)
When you build this on Replit:

Ensure wallet connection is smooth (use libraries like web3.js, ethers.js, or solana/web3.js)

Use a clean and professional design (TailwindCSS or any UI framework of your choice)

Integrate a smart contract interaction layer

Store data (contribution points, NFT metadata) securely and transparently

Consider using Replit DB for testing, or integrate with Polygon/Solana testnet
